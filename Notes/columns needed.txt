How we plan on using the data to answer the questions:

1: 
aggregate the population data across each state and compare across the years.

2: 
calculate population percentage change for each state across the years and compare to other states.

3:
aggregate rural and urban population across states and compare across the years

8:
Divide each racial demographic (white, asian, etc) by the total population to get the percentage.
Add mixed race total values together and divide by total population.
This gives percentage of the country for each race, and can be compared to the other decades to see change over time.

For ethnicity, sum up the total of each race that identifies as hispanic/latino (as well as mixed race).
Subtract the non-hispanic/latino totals for each race from the total count of each race (from the previous columns) to get hispanic/latino totals.
Divide hispanic/latino totals for each race by sum of each race (EX: sum of whites that identify as hispanic / sum of whites) to get % of hispanic/latino
Can sum the mixed race, non-latino values and subtract from mixed race total values to get % of mixed race that identifies as latino/hispanic

9:
 Add total occupied and total vacant to get total housing count. Divide each by total housing to get % occupied/vacant.
Compare housing unit count (HU100) to the previously calculated total housing count.
Can use each state's population count (POP100) for each decade to see which states gained and lost population.
For each state, can determine if occupied/vacant ratio went up or down between decades.

11:
we can get the average household size by diving the population(pop100) by the number of housing units(hu100) for each state(state/stusab)


13:
grab the housing unit count (HU100) and sum it for a total across all states and compare across years

group the sum by state instead for a comparison across the years by state
