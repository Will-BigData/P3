1. create "field_names.csv" that has the fields names that group 1 extracted

2. create "fn_desc.csv" that matches the fields names group 1 extracted with its description

3. put "original_p3_data" folder in Hadoop (contains the original field data extracted from 2000, 2010, 2020 census)

4.put "field_names.csv" in Hadoop

5. check if data is extracted correctly:
	how: max( POP100) by state 
	check: 2020 New Mexico Population = 2,117,522 (https://data.census.gov/profile/New_Mexico?g=040XX00US35)
	check: 2020 Texas Population = 29,145,505 (https://data.census.gov/profile/Texas?g=040XX00US48)
	myResult with powerBI: 2020 New Mexico Population = 2,117,522
	myResult with powerBI: 2020 Texas Population = 29,145,505
	data is extracted correctly for these columns. the way the data is formatted it includes records were the total is already calculated for you. so max(col_name) instead of sum(col_name)



6. find out the unit of measurement for AREALAND and AREADWATER
	ANSWSER: it is probably square meter (mÂ²)
	CHECK: convert New Mexico AREALAND TO square miles for the year 2020 and see if it equals 121,280.1 square miles (https://data.census.gov/profile/New_Mexico?g=040XX00US35)
	result: does not match
	reason 1: AREALAND and AREAWATER might use sqare meter as unit of measurement
