1. create "field_names.csv" that has the fields names that group 1 extracted

2. create "fn_desc.csv" that matches the fields names group 1 extracted with its description

3. put "original_p3_data" folder in Hadoop (contains the original field data extracted from 2000, 2010, 2020 census)

4.put "field_names.csv" in Hadoop

5. check if data is extracted correctly:
	how: max( POP100) by state 
	check: 2020 New Mexico Population = 2,117,522 (https://data.census.gov/profile/New_Mexico?g=040XX00US35)
	check: 2020 Texas Population = 29,145,505 (https://data.census.gov/profile/Texas?g=040XX00US48)
	myResult with powerBI: 2020 New Mexico Population = 2,117,522
	myResult with powerBI: 2020 Texas Population = 29,145,505
	data is extracted correctly for these columns. the way the data is formatted it includes records were the total is already calculated for you. so max(col_name) instead of sum(col_name). Or use SUMLEVL column

5. SUMLEVEL = 40 doesn't have all the AREALAND and AREAWATER state data for 2020 so just focus on the 2000 and 2010 cences data for this analysis. 

6. calculate total AREALAND and AREAWATER by state.

7. calulate the land to water ratio and the land to water difference 

8. find out the unit of measurement for AREALAND and AREAWATER and check if data calulations correspond with the census data
	ANSWSER: it is probably square meter (mÂ²)
	How to check example: convert New Mexico AREALAND TO square miles for the year 2010 (SUMLEVEL = 40 doesn't have all the AREALAND and AREAWATER state data for 2020)and see if it is close to 121,280.1 square miles (https://data.census.gov/profile/New_Mexico?g=040XX00US35)
	CHECK: 2020 New Mexico AREALAND = 121,280.1 square miles, 2020 new mexico AREAWATER = 280.9 square miles
	CHECK: 2020 Texas AREALAND = 261,193.9 square miles, 2020 new mexico AREAWATER = 7,330.9 square mile
	CHECK: 2020 Oklahoma AREALAND = 68,577.8 square miles, 2010 Oklahoma AREAWATER =  1,302.7  square miles	
	pyspark result: 2010 New Mexico AREALAND = 121,297.5 square miles, 2010 new mexico AREAWATER = 292.1 square miles
	pyspark result: 2010 Texas AREALAND = 261,230.2 square miles, 2010 Texas AREAWATER = 7,364.7 square miles
	pyspark result: 2010 Oklahoma AREALAND =  68,594.5 square miles, 2010 Oklahoma AREAWATER =  1,303.9 square miles

	calculations are close, difference might be due to change over time from 2010 to 2020.
	
9. find the top 10 states with biggest difference in land to water ratio from year 2000 to 2010.
