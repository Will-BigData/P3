# Project 3: US Census Data 

US Census Data is a Big Data project that analyzes the United States population from 2000 to 2020 every decade. The data contains over 60 million records, is mined into cloud storage, and is queried to answer questions posed by the project manager. The conclusions drawn from the queries suggest future trends, such as population growth for the next decade. The queries were optimized using PySpark and Spark SQL and shown visually with a data visualization tool.
